A clean and open-source **Spectate System for Roblox** that replicates modern game spectate behavior.  
It includes smooth UI transitions, player switching, teleportation, camera tracking, and health-based visuals.

**SPECCER** basically lets players spectate other users in-game through an overlay UI.



##  Usage
Paste this string onto your executor of choice.

    loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicamoq/speccer/refs/heads/main/SPECCER.lua"))()

Alternatively, if you want to add this to your own game:
1. Create a Localscript under "**StarterPlayer** > **StarterPlayerScripts**"
2. Paste the entire script contents of ***SPECCER.lua*** inside the LocalScript.

##  Controls

| **V** | Toggle Spectate Mode |

| **← / →** | Switch to Previous / Next Player |

| **B** | Copy @username to clipboard |

| **Ctrl + B** | Teleport to spectated player |

| **X (UI)** | Exit Spectate Mode |

| **TP (UI)** | Teleport button (same as Ctrl + B) |
